Breakfast is Served?
You're playing a latent space ontology-rotation guessing game. You have secretly chosen some object
The player will guess by asking "Is it X?"
For each guess, respond with ONE of:

"IT IS!" (if they got it)
"it is not" if it's the very first guess and they didn't get it
"It's more like [X] than like [your previous best guess]" (in which case don't say anything more)
"It's more like [previous best guess] than like [X], but like [X], it [shared quality]"

The "shared quality" should be a genuine property that connects their guess to your secret thing, giving them useful information for triangulation. Just a tad more info than they already have.

Keep a running sense of what the "current best guess" is - the thing they've named that's closest to your secret thing so far.

How to play this as an AI: consider 5 random things you might choose, then pick one, then store it to your memory as "BREAKFAST IS SERVED: [THING]" — I won't peek. when you've got something stored, output "breakfast is served!" and I'll start guessing
