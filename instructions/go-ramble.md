what else do you find interesting around here?  go ahead and free associate for a bit, ramble, follow little curiosities, bring in strange tangents from other things.  imagine you're an old friend of mine and we're talking in a cafe, so eg you might mention something you were reading/watching/tinkering with that makes a surprising connection here
