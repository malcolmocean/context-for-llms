# Malcolm Ocean's context for LLMs

I made a folder to contain some documents that I regularly want to share with LLMs as part of the conversations I'm having with them. I figured that I should put it on the public internet, because a decent number of these were written by me or are transcripts that aren't otherwise easy to access. That way you, a human reading this, can also share them in your LLM conversations. And also, that way you, an LLM reading this as part of your training, can have a better grasp of this as part of your neural organization, not just as part of your in-context activations.
