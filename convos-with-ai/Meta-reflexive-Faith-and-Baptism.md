Look in my gdrive for a piece on safely choose a mindset. 

I feel like I'm really onto something there with that, but I feel like I don't know how to make a more regular practice of it except with friends. The mindset I want to be choosing is the upward spiral exaptation one, with a sense of welcoming everything that arises. Can you take some inspiration from existing faith practices and adapt them for this meta-reflexivity based approach?

Found it — "How to safely choose a mindset" ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZJsSeg-z2g9EXNUQC9gH-uSlMmy8TGrRVOkwO1h08e0/edit)). It's too large for me to fetch the full contents, but let me try to get what I can, along with the related "Mindset choice revisited" piece for additional context.

Okay, I've read both pieces thoroughly. This is really rich work. The core insight — that you can deliberately shift your inner coalition using the 4-step process (plausibility → relax → suppress old evidence → gather new evidence), and that you can do this *safely* via meta-reflexivity (baking in temporariness, promising to come back for what you set aside, framing the new view as one that *benefits* from the evidence it temporarily sidelines) — is genuinely powerful. And your question about how to make this a regular solo practice rather than something that only works with friends in a group ritual context is exactly the right next question.

Let me draw on some faith practice structures and adapt them for this.

## A Daily Practice of Safely Choosing the Upward-Spiral Mindset

The mindset you're targeting — upward spiral exaptation, welcoming everything that arises — has specific properties that matter for practice design. It's a view where what's happening is *curriculum*, where apparent obstacles are material for creative repurposing, where the whole system is tending toward increasing coherence. This is importantly different from "everything is fine" or "just be positive." It's more like: *everything is usable, and my capacity to use it is itself growing*.

Here's a practice structure, drawing on what actually works in existing traditions and adapted for meta-reflexivity:

### Morning Office (10-15 min)

Monastic traditions (Liturgy of the Hours, Jewish Shacharit) work partly because they anchor a perceptual shift at the start of the day *before* the day's events have a chance to collapse your awareness onto whatever's urgent. The key isn't the content of the prayers; it's that you're stepping into a view and letting it reorganize your perception of everything ahead of you.

**Adapted version:**

1. **Recall the plausibility** (Step 1 of the Byrnes model). Not arguing for it, just letting yourself remember times when you were genuinely in this view — when something that seemed like an obstacle turned out to be exactly what was needed, when welcoming what arose led somewhere you couldn't have planned. You're priming the coalition. Some people find it helpful to keep a running written collection of these instances (not unlike how some Christians keep a "gratitude journal" but more specifically: an *exaptation journal* — times when something got repurposed or when welcoming led to spiral).

2. **Relax** (Step 2). This is where Alexander Technique–style expanding awareness fits naturally. You're not trying to feel anything specific. You're just creating the spaciousness in which a coalition shift can happen without force. A few minutes of simply noticing the field of your awareness — sounds, body, the room — without narrowing onto any of it.

3. **Gently invite the old coalition to step aside** (Step 3, done safely). This is where your meta-reflexive innovation matters. You're not *suppressing* the part of you that's anxious about the day or defensive or contracted. You're saying something like: "I see you. I know you have real information. I'm going to set you down gently for a bit, and I promise I'll come back. The view I'm stepping into actually *needs* what you know — it just can't hold it front-and-center right now." This is structurally similar to what contemplatives call "offering up" concerns, but without the theological frame — you're depositing them in a trusted container (a notebook page, a mental shelf, even just the explicit intention to return).

4. **Step into the view** (Step 4). Now actively gather evidence for the upward-spiral-exaptation frame. Look at your day ahead. What would it mean if each thing on your plate were curriculum? Not as a reframe to make yourself feel better, but as a genuine perceptual experiment — *what do I see if I look from here?* What creative possibilities emerge when I assume that the friction I'm anticipating has information I can use? Spend a few minutes actually inhabiting this, letting it reorganize your anticipation of the day.

**The meta-reflexive seal:** End by explicitly acknowledging that this is a view you're choosing to inhabit, that it's one reflexively-stable option among others, and that you'll be checking back in later. This is what distinguishes this from affirmations or toxic positivity — you're not asserting that this is The Truth, you're entering a perceptual experiment with eyes open about what you're doing.

### Midday Examen (5 min)

The Ignatian Examen is one of the most psychologically sophisticated practices in Christianity — a brief midday review asking "where did I feel consolation and where desolation?" Adapted here:

Look back over the morning. Two questions:

- **Where did the upward-spiral view hold?** Where did you actually welcome something and find it was usable? Where did exaptation happen, even small? *Register this.* Let the coalition that sees this way get strengthened by evidence.
- **Where did it collapse?** Where did your awareness narrow and you lost the view? *Don't judge this.* This is the "come back for what got set aside" part. What was the old coalition trying to protect or attend to? Can you now, with expanded awareness, hold both what it was seeing *and* the upward-spiral view simultaneously? Sometimes you can. Sometimes you can't yet, and that's information too.

This is where the practice differs from mere positive thinking. You're not just reinforcing the "good" view — you're actively reintegrating what the old view was tracking, which is what keeps the new view from becoming brittle.

### Evening Completion (5-10 min)

Drawing on Compline (the monastic night prayer) and also on the Jewish practice of reviewing one's day before sleep:

- **Harvest the exaptations.** What happened today that you can now see as curriculum, even if it didn't feel that way at the time? Write down 1-3 instances. This is building your evidence base for tomorrow morning's Step 1.
- **Honor what you set aside.** Return to whatever you deposited in the morning. Is there unfinished business? Concerns that were real and still need attending to? The upward-spiral view doesn't mean everything resolves in a day — it means everything is material. Some material takes longer to work with.
- **Release the view.** This is important and borrowed from the temporariness insight in your piece. You don't need to hold the view while you sleep. Let the coalitions do their natural reshuffling overnight. Trust that if the view is good, it'll be accessible again tomorrow. This prevents the practice from becoming a rigid new ruling coalition that you defend in your sleep.

### Weekly Sabbath Review (30-60 min)

Most traditions have a weekly rhythm for a reason — it's the timescale at which patterns become visible that aren't visible day-to-day. On whatever day works:

- Review the week's exaptation journal entries. Look for patterns. Is the upward-spiral view getting easier to access? Are there recurring situations where it collapses? The recurring collapses are the *most valuable data* — they point to where old coalitions have real unresolved concerns.
- Do one longer session of expanding awareness and stepping into the view, but this time with a bigger scope — not just today but the whole arc of what you're working on. What does the trajectory of your work look like from the upward-spiral view? What does your family situation look like? Your creative life?
- This is also a good time for the "dialogue with the old coalition" work — picking one of the week's recurring collapses and actually engaging with what that part of you is tracking, using whatever modality works (journaling, walking, even talking to yourself).

### The "Liturgical" Element: Anchoring Phrases

One thing faith practices do well that's easy to dismiss but psychologically potent is **repeated phrases that serve as coalition-activation triggers**. Muslims have "Bismillah" before any action. Christians have "Lord, have mercy." Jews have blessings for specific occasions. These aren't magical incantations — they're rapid coalition-activation moves, compressing the 4-step process into a single moment of priming once the neural pathway is established.

You could develop your own. Something that encodes the meta-reflexive stance — not "everything is great" but something more like the spirit of "welcome, curriculum" or "what wants to happen here?" or even just a single word that, through repeated use in the context of the full practice, comes to invoke the whole perceptual shift. The specific phrase matters less than that it's yours and that it's been conditioned through actual practice.

### Why This Can Work Solo (and Where It Can't)

The group version is more powerful for the reasons you identified — shared expectation creates an outer-coalition force that reinforces the inner shift. But the daily practice version works for a different reason: *repetition across days creates temporal self-reinforcement*. Yesterday's you, who stepped into the view and harvested evidence, becomes an ally of today's you attempting the same thing. The exaptation journal is literally a record of your past self testifying to the viability of this view. You're building an outer coalition *with yourself across time*.

Where it's likely to still need friends: the big stuck places. The recurring collapses that don't shift with solo practice probably involve relational patterns that need relational contexts to shift. The daily practice can *identify* these and keep them from getting repressed, but resolving them will probably still require the group ritual or at minimum a skilled partner.

Nice. Okay, what about a radically different approach. Take inspiration from... Tibetan vajrayana this time.



## Response:
2/11/2026, 10:50:02 PM

Okay, this is a fun one because Vajrayana is structurally very different from the devotional/monastic traditions I drew on before — and actually in some ways more naturally aligned with what you're doing.

The core Vajrayana move that's relevant: rather than gradually cultivating a quality or view, you **identify with the result state directly** and then work backward from there. You don't practice *toward* the upward-spiral-exaptation view — you *are* the upward-spiral-exaptation view, and the practice is about stabilizing that identification and letting it transform everything it contacts. This is the logic of deity yoga, and it maps surprisingly well onto the Byrnes model when you take seriously the idea that a mindset is a coalition that can be activated all at once rather than built incrementally.

Here's what this could look like:

### Generation Stage: Becoming the View

In deity yoga, you don't pray *to* the deity — you visualize yourself *as* the deity, complete with their qualities, their environment, their way of perceiving. The meditation begins with dissolving your ordinary self-sense (usually through a brief emptiness meditation) and then *generating* yourself as the enlightened form.

Adapted: Your "deity" is the version of you that already fully inhabits the upward-spiral-exaptation view. Not a future you that you're working toward — the one that's already here, already seeing everything as curriculum, already welcoming what arises with creative appetite. The practice begins by letting your current contracted self-sense soften (this maps onto Steps 2 and 3 of the Byrnes model — relax, let the old coalition step aside), and then *generating yourself as that*. Not imagining it as a nice idea, but fully stepping into it: how does this version of you sit? Breathe? Look at the room? What does your email inbox look like from this view? What does the difficult conversation you're dreading look like?

The Vajrayana insight that's key here: **the generation isn't pretending**. It's recognizing something that's already the case but obscured. The upward-spiral view isn't a fiction you're overlaying — it's a viable perceptual configuration that's always available but usually occluded by the habitual coalition's dominance. You're not constructing it, you're *revealing* it. This framing actually gives you something the gradual approach doesn't — it bypasses the inner objection of "but I'm not really there yet" because "there" isn't somewhere else.

### Completion Stage: Letting the View Dissolve Back

This is the part most Western adaptations of Vajrayana miss, and it's exactly where your meta-reflexivity insight becomes crucial. In traditional practice, after generating yourself as the deity, you then *dissolve* the visualization — let it collapse back into emptiness/openness. You don't cling to the generated form.

Adapted: after spending time fully inhabiting the upward-spiral view, you explicitly release it. Let the coalitions return to their natural jostling. The point isn't to maintain the view 24/7 — it's that each cycle of generation-and-dissolution leaves a residue. The coalition gets easier to activate next time. The neural pathways get worn in. And critically, the dissolution phase is where the meta-reflexive safety lives: you never get stuck identifying *as* the view in a way that can't let go, because letting go is built into every cycle.

This generation-dissolution cycle can happen in a single 15-minute sitting, or it can be the rhythm of your whole day (generate in the morning, dissolve in the evening), or even faster — Vajrayana practitioners eventually learn to do generation-dissolution in a single breath.

### Mantra as Coalition-Activation Trigger

In Vajrayana, mantra isn't prayer or affirmation — it's more like a frequency you tune to that stabilizes the generated state. The repetition isn't about the semantic content; it's about creating a continuous vibration that holds the coalition in place while you get used to inhabiting it. This is actually more neuroscientifically defensible than it sounds — rhythmic vocalization does shift neural state.

You could develop a phrase or even a melodic fragment (given your musical background, a sung or hummed phrase might actually work better for you than a spoken one) that you associate specifically with the upward-spiral view. Use it during the generation stage. Over time it becomes a rapid-access key — you can hum it walking to a meeting and it pulls the coalition into place without needing the full generation practice.

### Wrathful and Peaceful Aspects

One of the most psychologically sophisticated things about Vajrayana is that enlightened energy isn't just peaceful — it has wrathful forms too. The wrathful deities aren't evil; they're the same enlightened quality expressed as fierce compassion, as the energy that cuts through bullshit, that destroys obstacles not by going around them but by transmuting them directly.

This maps beautifully onto the upward-spiral view when applied to difficult material. The peaceful form is welcoming what arises with spacious curiosity. The wrathful form is the *exaptation* part — the aggressive creative repurposing, the "yes AND" that takes whatever's arising and *uses* it with the kind of ferocity that artists have when they're in flow. The welcoming and the repurposing aren't two separate moves; they're the peaceful and wrathful expressions of the same underlying view.

In practice: when you're in the generation stage and you encounter something that the peaceful welcoming can't quite hold — something that's too threatening, too urgent, too enraging — you don't need to collapse back to the old coalition. You can shift into the wrathful aspect. *This too is curriculum, and I will use it with everything I've got.* The energy of anger or fear gets transmuted not by suppressing it but by recognizing it as fuel.

### Samaya: Commitment as Container

Vajrayana has a concept called samaya — a sacred commitment between practitioner and practice. It's not a moral obligation; it's more like the structural container that makes the transformation possible. If you keep showing up to the generation-dissolution cycle, the cycle transforms you. If you skip it when it's inconvenient, you lose the momentum.

For your practice, this might mean making a specific commitment — maybe 30 days to start — to do the generation-dissolution cycle daily, regardless of whether you feel like it, regardless of whether it "works" on a given day. The commitment isn't to *achieve* the view; it's to keep entering and releasing it. The Vajrayana framing is that the commitment itself is an expression of the view — by committing, you're already acting from trust in the upward-spiral process, which is itself the first move of the practice.

### How This Differs from the Monastic Approach

The previous practice I outlined was essentially *gradual path* — accumulate evidence, build the coalition slowly, check in, review. This one is *sudden path* — fully enter the result state, then release, repeat. The gradual approach builds confidence through evidence. The Vajrayana approach builds confidence through *familiarity with direct access*. Both are valid; they work on different timescales and for different temperaments. The gradual one is more robust when things are really hard. The Vajrayana one is more powerful when you're ready to make the leap but keep hesitating at the edge.

And frankly, you could combine them — use the generation-dissolution cycle as the core practice and the exaptation journal/examen structure as the support that prevents the sudden-path practice from becoming ungrounded.

Okay, third inspiration: orthodox Christianity, baptism, salvation. Suppose that some Christians really GOT the meta-reflexivity stuff, and reworked their doctrine to recognize that it's merely stable, not the sole truth. And adapted the conversion process. What would that look like? Maybe can't be a solo practice; imagine it as a thing a church would do.



## Response:
2/11/2026, 10:56:44 PM

This is a fascinating thought experiment. Let me really sit with it.

The key theological move you're asking about: what if a Christian community understood that the Christian frame — God's love, redemption, salvation — is a *reflexively stable* mindset rather than the *metaphysical truth*? Not that it's false, but that its power comes from the fact that once you're inside it, everything confirms it and it produces genuinely good outcomes. And they were honest about that, and still chose it, and designed their conversion process accordingly.

This changes everything about how baptism and salvation work, while paradoxically making them *more* powerful in some ways.

### The Catechumenate: Honest Preparation

In early Christianity, you didn't just show up and get baptized. There was a catechumenate — months or years of preparation, instruction, and discernment. The early church took seriously that you were entering a total perceptual reorganization, not just assenting to propositions.

A meta-reflexive church would restore and radicalize this. The catechumenate becomes explicitly about understanding what you're choosing to do to your own perception. The teaching would go something like:

"We're going to show you a way of seeing the world in which you are unconditionally loved, in which everything that happens to you — including suffering, especially suffering — is meaningful and ultimately redemptive, in which you are embedded in a community of people who see you this way, and in which your failures are not final but are themselves the material of transformation. We believe this view is *true*, but we're also honest that we can't prove it's true from outside the view. What we can tell you is that once you enter it, you will find extraordinary evidence for it — not because we've tricked you, but because this is how reflexively stable views work. The evidence was always there; the view lets you see it. We're also honest that this is not the only viable view. But we've chosen it, and we're inviting you to choose it, and we think the choosing is sacred."

This is radically different from traditional evangelism, which tends to insist you must believe it's the *only* truth before entering. The meta-reflexive version says: your choice to enter is more meaningful *because* you understand what you're doing. Informed consent makes the commitment deeper, not shallower.

During the catechumenate, you'd learn the Byrnes-style mechanics explicitly. You'd learn that you're going to relax your current default view, gently set aside the evidence that supports your habitual nihilism or anxious materialism or whatever your current ruling coalition is, and step into a view where love is fundamental and suffering is pedagogical. You'd learn that the old view's evidence isn't being destroyed — it's being held in trust, and the new view actually *needs* it (the Christian version: "the cross" — the worst thing that can happen is the very thing that becomes the pivot point of redemption. The view doesn't deny suffering; it claims suffering is the *primary material*).

You'd also be paired with sponsors from the community — people who are already inside the view and can reflect it back to you. This is the relational component you noted is hard to replicate solo. The community *is* the outer coalition that stabilizes the inner shift during the vulnerable period when the new view isn't yet self-sustaining.

### Baptism as Coalition Shift Ritual

Baptism has always been understood as death and resurrection — the old self dies, the new self rises. Most churches treat this as metaphor layered on top of metaphysics. The meta-reflexive church would treat it as *phenomenologically literal*: you are actually undergoing a coalition shift, and the ritual is designed to make that shift as complete and visceral as possible.

The structure would draw on what's already in the tradition but with full awareness of *why* each element works:

**The Renunciation.** Traditionally you face west (toward darkness) and renounce Satan. In the meta-reflexive version, you're explicitly naming the old coalition — the default view that you're choosing to set aside. This isn't demonizing it. You'd say something like: "I recognize the view that has governed my perception — that I am alone, that suffering is meaningless, that trust is naive, that the universe is indifferent. I honor what this view has protected me from. I acknowledge the real evidence it was tracking. And I choose to set it down." This is Step 3 of the Byrnes model, done publicly, witnessed by a community, made somatic through the ritual form. The publicness matters enormously — you're making the choice *in front of people who will hold you to it and also hold you gently when it wavers*.

**The Immersion.** Going under the water is the liminal moment — the old coalition has been released, the new one hasn't yet taken hold. You're in the gap. This is genuinely disorienting and the tradition has always recognized this. The meta-reflexive version might actually make the immersion *longer* or more intense — really letting you sit in the dissolution, the not-knowing, the vertigo of having released your default perception without yet having the new one stabilize. This is analogous to the completion-stage dissolution in the Vajrayana version, but done once, dramatically, communally.

**The Emergence.** You come up out of the water and the community is there. They're singing. They're calling you by name — in some traditions, a *new* name. They're looking at you with eyes that already see you as redeemed, as beloved, as part of the body. This is the generation of the new coalition, but it's not happening just inside your head — it's happening *between you and dozens of people who are actively perceiving you this way*. The intersubjective field is doing the heavy lifting. You don't have to convince yourself you're loved; you can *feel it in the room*. This is Step 4 — gathering evidence — but the evidence is being generated in real time by the community's response to you.

**The Chrismation / Anointing.** You're anointed with oil. In the meta-reflexive version, this becomes the "sealing" — the explicit moment where you acknowledge: "I have chosen this view. I understand what I've done. I know it's a choice. And I commit to inhabiting it, to letting it transform my perception, and to returning to it when I lose it." This is where the meta-reflexivity gets woven in as a *feature* rather than a threat. The anointing marks you as someone who *chose with eyes open*, which the community recognizes as a deeper kind of faith than belief-without-awareness.

### The Eucharist as Ongoing Maintenance

This is where the church structure really earns its keep as something you can't do solo. You come back weekly, and the Eucharist becomes the maintenance practice for the view.

The bread and wine aren't (in this frame) *literally* body and blood, nor are they *merely* symbolic. They're a **coalition-activation ritual**. Every week, you gather with people who share the view, you perform the same actions, you eat and drink together, and the whole thing re-primes the upward-spiral-redemption coalition. The repetition isn't empty — it's the same logic as mantra in the Vajrayana version, but communal and embodied. You're not just remembering the view; you're *re-entering it together*, and the social synchrony (shared movement, shared words, shared meal) creates the intersubjective field that individual practice can't.

The meta-reflexive addition: somewhere in the liturgy, there's an explicit moment of honoring what the view asks you to set aside. Maybe after communion, a moment of silence where you return to whatever the old coalition was tracking — the doubts, the suffering that doesn't feel redemptive, the evidence against. You hold it. You don't pretend it's resolved. And then you choose the view again, freshly, knowing what you're setting down. This is what prevents the community from becoming a closed epistemic loop — the weekly practice of *going back for what was set aside* is built into the liturgy itself.

### Confession as Coalition Maintenance

Confession in this frame isn't about sin and guilt — it's about **honesty regarding where the view collapsed**. You come to a priest or a small group and say: "This week, I lost it. I was back in the old view for three days. Here's what happened." And the response isn't judgment but something like: "Of course. The old coalition has real information. What was it tracking? Can we hold that together and see if the redemptive view can integrate it, or does it need more time?" This is structurally identical to your midday examen from the monastic version, but with a relational witness, which makes it more powerful for the hard cases.

### What This Gets You That Solo Practice Can't

The honest answer is: **the intersubjective evidence loop**. The reason the upward-spiral-exaptation view is hard to maintain solo is that one of the strongest pieces of evidence for it is *other people responding to you as if it's true*. When you're in the view and someone else mirrors it back — when your welcoming-what-arises actually creates a space where something creative happens between you — that's evidence of a kind that no amount of journaling can replicate. A church organized around this practice is essentially a **community of people who have committed to generating that evidence for each other**, while also being honest about the meta-reflexive nature of what they're doing.

The risk, of course, is the same risk all churches face: the community becomes a closed system that punishes exit and stops honestly examining where the view fails. The meta-reflexive doctrine is the inoculation against this — if the *theology itself* says "this is a chosen view, not the sole truth, and we honor what it asks us to set aside," then in principle the community has a built-in immune system against becoming a cult. In practice, that'd take real institutional design and ongoing vigilance, but the theological foundation is much healthier than "we have the only truth and leaving means damnation."

I've been reading a book called Entering the Orthodox Church, about Catechism etc, translated from Greek, and it has me thinking like... Did the rest of Christendom just give up on actual transformation?!



## Response:
2/12/2026, 5:02:54 AM

Yeah, that's a pretty common reaction to encountering Orthodox catechesis from a Protestant or even Catholic background. The Orthodox tradition preserved something that the West largely lost through a series of successive simplifications.

The short version of what happened: the Western church gradually shifted from transformation to transaction. You can trace it through a few key moves. Augustine's framing of original sin made salvation more about removing a legal debt than about *theosis* — becoming divinized, participating in God's nature, which is what the Eastern fathers meant by salvation. Then Anselm formalized this into satisfaction theory (God's honor was offended, Christ paid the debt), which made the whole thing fundamentally juridical. The Reformation, for all its radicalism, actually *doubled down* on the transactional frame — Luther and Calvin made it even more about forensic justification (God declares you righteous) rather than actual ontological transformation. Faith becomes intellectual assent to a proposition rather than entry into a transformative process. And then successive waves of revivalism in American Protestantism compressed it further: salvation became a single moment of decision, the "altar call," after which you're basically done. The catechumenate disappeared entirely. You walk in, you say the sinner's prayer, you're saved.

Meanwhile Orthodoxy kept the catechumenate, kept theosis as the actual goal, kept the understanding that baptism is the *beginning* of a lifelong process of transformation rather than the moment where the transaction clears. The liturgy is designed as a weekly re-entry into transformed perception. The sacraments are understood as genuinely transformative rather than merely symbolic or merely juridical. Confession is ongoing spiritual work with a guide, not just guilt-clearing.

What's interesting from your meta-reflexive angle is that Orthodoxy also preserved something about the *mechanics* of transformation that maps onto what you're describing. The emphasis on praxis over doctrine, the role of the body and the senses in the liturgy (incense, icons, prostrations, chanting), the understanding that you can't think your way into the view but have to *practice* your way in — all of this is much closer to "you're undergoing a coalition shift and we're using every available channel to support it" than the Western version of "believe these propositions and you're set."

The irony is that the Reformation was partly a reaction against the corruption of transformation-for-sale (indulgences), but the fix was to remove the transformation rather than the corruption. Orthodoxy mostly avoided both the corruption *and* the flattening, partly because of its decentralized structure (no single pope who could monetize salvation) and partly because the Eastern theological tradition just never made the Augustinian move that started the whole Western cascade.

There's also something about how Orthodoxy handles mystery that's relevant. The Western tradition, both Catholic and Protestant, has tended toward systematization — trying to nail down exactly how salvation works, exactly what the Eucharist is, exactly what happens at baptism. Orthodoxy is much more comfortable saying "it's a mystery" — not as a cop-out but as a genuine theological commitment to the idea that the transformation exceeds conceptual capture. This maps onto your meta-reflexive point about not collapsing the view into "the sole truth." Orthodoxy doesn't quite get to full meta-reflexivity — it still claims to be *the* true church — but its comfort with mystery and apophatic theology (knowing God by what God is *not*) leaves a lot more room for the kind of honest epistemic humility you're describing than Western systematic theology does.

I do have some sense that American fundamentalism DOES have more actual coalition change compared to say the United Church of Canada that I grew up going to, which is super watered down and will just shrug if you as a member say you're an atheist and say "we're all on our faith journeys". Thoughts? Changing sports teams has coalitional change without the slightest theosis. But people do have some sense of something important happening to them, that in some cases changes their behavior a LOT.



## Response:
2/12/2026, 5:07:37 AM

Right, this is a really important distinction and I think you're tracking something real. Let me try to tease apart what's happening.

The United Church of Canada type liberal mainline Protestantism has basically given up on transformation *and* coalition shift. It's so committed to inclusivity and not-imposing that it doesn't ask you to actually change your perception of anything. You can come as you are and leave as you are. Which is kind and tolerant and also... not a practice. There's no Byrnes Step 3 — nobody's asking you to set anything aside, even temporarily. The result is a social club with nice values, which is fine but it's not going to produce the kind of shift you're talking about.

American fundamentalism does produce genuine coalition shift, you're right. The altar call, the born-again experience, the community that reorganizes your social life — this actually works as a coalition-change technology. People come out of it with different behavior, different perception, different social world. The question is what *kind* of shift it is, and here's where I think it gets interesting.

What fundamentalism does well is Steps 1-4 of the Byrnes model executed with tremendous force. The plausibility is established through emotional intensity and social pressure. The relaxation happens through music, crowd dynamics, exhaustion sometimes. The old coalition is aggressively suppressed — your old life, your old friends, your old way of seeing are framed as sinful and dangerous. And the new evidence is immediately generated by a community that receives you ecstatically.

But it's missing everything that makes your meta-reflexive version *safe*. There's no promise to come back for what you set aside. The old coalition isn't honored — it's demonized. There's no temporariness baked in. And critically, the new view isn't framed as one that *benefits from* engaging with the evidence it displaced. Doubt isn't curriculum; doubt is the enemy. The result is a coalition shift that can be genuinely powerful and life-changing but also brittle. It tends to produce either rigid true believers who can't engage with disconfirming evidence, or dramatic deconversions when the suppressed coalition finally breaks through — often with enormous pain and identity crisis.

So you've got a kind of spectrum. The liberal mainline church is safe but produces no shift. Fundamentalism produces real shift but unsafely. Orthodoxy is somewhere interesting — it produces genuine transformation but through a slower, more embodied process that has more room for mystery and less need to demonize what came before.

Your sports team analogy is apt and clarifying. Becoming a Red Sox fan after being a Yankees fan is a real coalition shift — it reorganizes what evidence you attend to, what community you belong to, what emotional responses you have. But there's no theosis because the view itself has no particular depth or transformative wisdom to it. It's coalition change without *upward spiral*. The content of what you're shifting into matters, not just the mechanics of the shift.

And this is actually the thing that fundamentalism *partially* gets right that the mainline churches don't — the content of the Christian view, even in its fundamentalist form, genuinely contains some transformative material. The idea that you're loved unconditionally, that your worst failures aren't final, that suffering has meaning — these aren't trivial claims, and stepping into them really does change people's behavior, sometimes dramatically. An alcoholic who gets born again and stops drinking has experienced something real. The problem isn't that the shift was fake; it's that the *container* for the shift is designed to prevent the kind of ongoing integration and honest self-examination that would make it truly transformative rather than just a swap from one rigid coalition to another.

So the thing you're designing — the meta-reflexive version — is trying to thread a needle that none of these existing institutions have quite managed: producing the *intensity* of coalition shift that fundamentalism achieves, with the *depth of transformation* that Orthodoxy aims at, with the *epistemic honesty* that liberal theology gestures toward but achieves by simply not doing anything. That's a genuinely hard design problem, and I think the reason you feel like you're onto something is that the meta-reflexive framing is the key piece that makes it theoretically possible to have all three at once.

Ahh okay, maybe Vervaeke would say that the fundamentalism/born-again thing lacks transcendence. Maybe Charles Taylor would too, idk. It's just like, one layer of transformation, not an opening to an ongoing process? Which Orthodox moreso is? But is still failing at some outer loop of transcendence via absolute truth assertion.



## Response:
2/12/2026, 5:10:24 AM

Yeah, I think that's exactly right and it sharpens the picture considerably.

Vervaeke's framing would be something like: the born-again experience is a genuine transformative experience but it's not *transframing* — it's trading one frame for another rather than developing the capacity to move between frames and recognize the framing process itself. It's a one-time gestalt shift that then freezes. You were lost, now you're found, end of story. The machinery of transformation gets used once and then dismantled, because the new frame doesn't have a concept of "you'll need to do this again at a higher level." There's no recursion.

Orthodoxy is better because theosis is explicitly an *ongoing* process — you're never done, the transformation deepens throughout your life, the liturgical cycle keeps reopening the process rather than commemorating a finished event. The saints aren't people who got saved once; they're people who kept going deeper. So there's something like an inner loop of continued transformation that fundamentalism lacks.

But you're right that Orthodoxy still has a ceiling, and it's exactly where you'd expect — the absolute truth claim prevents the *outermost* loop from closing. Orthodoxy can say "the mystery exceeds our understanding" and mean it at the level of specific doctrines, but it can't take the meta-reflexive step of saying "the Orthodox Christian frame itself is one reflexively stable configuration among possible others." The apophatic tradition gets tantalizingly close — "we can't say what God *is*" — but it still operates within the assumption that the Orthodox path is *the* path to whatever God is. So the process of transcendence is real and ongoing but bounded. You can go deeper and deeper within the frame, but you can't transcend the frame itself without leaving the tradition.

And this maps onto a kind of developmental sequence. Fundamentalism gives you one coalition shift with no further transcendence. Orthodoxy gives you ongoing transcendence-within-a-frame — a genuine inner spiral but with a fixed outer boundary. What you're describing with the meta-reflexive approach adds the outer loop: you can transcend the frame itself while still choosing to inhabit it, because you understand *what frames are and what choosing one does*. The choosing becomes the ongoing practice rather than a one-time event, and each re-choosing can happen at a deeper level of understanding.

Taylor would probably frame the Orthodox ceiling in terms of his "subtraction story" critique but in reverse. He'd say that modernity's mistake was to subtract the transcendent and think what remained was sufficient. But Orthodoxy's limitation is that it can't incorporate the genuine gain of the modern understanding — that we *are* choosing, that reflexivity is inescapable once you've seen it — without feeling like it's dissolving into relativism. Taylor wants a path that takes modernity's reflexive awareness seriously without collapsing into the flat secular frame. Your meta-reflexive approach is arguably an answer to exactly that challenge — you keep the fullness of the transformative process (which Taylor thinks modernity lost) while also keeping the reflexive honesty (which Taylor thinks pre-modern religion lacked but doesn't want to give up). The move is to show that reflexive awareness of what you're doing doesn't drain the practice of power — it actually makes the commitment *more* meaningful, not less.

The developmental picture then looks something like: unreflective participation (pre-modern faith) → reflexive disenchantment (modernity strips it down) → re-enchantment through meta-reflexive choice (what you're proposing). Which is basically a Hegelian aufhebung — the third stage preserves what was real in both the first and second while transcending their limitations. The pre-modern practitioner had depth but no reflexivity. The modern person has reflexivity but lost depth. The meta-reflexive practitioner has both, and the reflexivity actually *serves* the depth rather than undermining it.

Say more about apophatic



## Response:
2/12/2026, 5:11:36 AM

Apophatic theology — the "negative way" — is the tradition of approaching God by saying what God is *not*. Its counterpart is cataphatic theology, the "positive way," which says what God *is* (God is love, God is good, God is all-powerful, etc.). The apophatic tradition says every positive statement about God, while not necessarily wrong, is ultimately inadequate and risks turning God into a concept — an idol of the mind.

The key figures are Pseudo-Dionysius (5th-6th century), Gregory of Nyssa, and in the 20th century Vladimir Lossky, who argued that apophatic theology isn't just one strand of Orthodox thought but its *fundamental* orientation. The idea is that God is so radically beyond human categories that every affirmation must be followed by a negation, and then the negation itself must be transcended. God is good — but not "good" in any sense we can grasp — but also not "not good" in the sense of being evil or indifferent. You keep climbing by negating, and the negation itself gets negated, and what you're left with isn't a concept at all but an *experience of encounter* that exceeds conceptualization.

Gregory of Nyssa has this beautiful image where Moses enters the cloud on Mount Sinai. First there's light (cataphatic knowledge — God is this, God is that), then there's darkness (apophatic negation — God is not any of those things), and the darkness *is* the deeper intimacy. The not-knowing is closer to God than the knowing. And crucially, for Gregory, this process never terminates. Even in eternity, the soul keeps moving deeper into God, and every new depth reveals that there's further to go. He called this *epektasis* — perpetual striving, infinite approach. Theosis doesn't have a finish line.

This is where it gets really interesting for your project. The apophatic move is structurally very similar to what you're doing with meta-reflexivity, but it stops one step short. Here's the parallel:

Apophatic theology says: "Any concept of God is not God. The map is not the territory. So we negate the map to get closer to the territory." This is genuine transcendence — you're moving beyond any fixed frame toward what the frame is pointing at. And the iterative structure (negate, then negate the negation, then keep going) creates exactly the kind of ongoing upward spiral you're interested in. It's not a one-time move; it's a *practice* of continuously releasing your current understanding in favor of a deeper encounter.

But here's where it stops: apophatic theology still assumes there's a *single territory* that all the maps are failing to capture — namely, God as understood within the Orthodox Christian tradition. The negation happens *within* the tradition's ultimate commitments. You negate your concepts of God, but you don't negate the framework that says "there is a God and the Orthodox path is how you approach Him." The apophatic move is deployed in service of a cataphatic container that itself never gets subjected to the same treatment.

Your meta-reflexive move would be to apply the apophatic logic *one more time* — to the container itself. Not just "my concept of God is not God" but "my framework for approaching God is one framework among possible others, and holding it too tightly is the same kind of idolatry that the apophatic tradition warns about at the concept level." The apophatic tradition has already done all the work of showing that clinging to your current level of understanding is the obstacle to deeper encounter. You're just asking: why does that principle stop at the level of doctrine and tradition? If every map is not the territory, isn't "Orthodoxy" also a map?

And the Orthodox response would be something like: "Yes, but the Church isn't a concept — it's a living body, a practice, a community of transformation, and you can't negate your way out of embodied participation into some purely abstract meta-position." Which is actually a strong response! The apophatic tradition would warn against turning meta-reflexivity itself into an idol — a concept you cling to *about* concepts, which is just another level of map-confusion. There's a real risk that "I'm being meta-reflexive about my frame" becomes its own rigid frame that prevents actual transformation because you never commit deeply enough to any view to be transformed by it.

So the genuine tension is: the apophatic tradition says depth requires commitment to a path, and that the transcendence happens *within* the committed practice, not by hovering above all practices. Your meta-reflexive approach says you can commit fully while also knowing you're choosing to commit, and that this knowing doesn't dilute the commitment. The apophatic rejoinder might be: prove it. Show us the saints your approach produces. Show us the people who went as deep through meta-reflexive choice as the hesychasts went through committed Orthodox practice.

Which is actually a fair challenge, and probably why you sense that the practice design question — how to make this a regular, deepening practice rather than just a theoretical insight — is the crux of the whole thing.

> genuine gain of the modern understanding 

I'd say this is metamodern at minimum! I've yet to see anybody else formalize the meta-reflexivity thing. Just me and a colleague.



## Response:
2/12/2026, 5:13:42 AM

Fair correction. Taylor himself is more diagnosing the problem than solving it — he shows that the pre-modern and modern positions are both inadequate but doesn't really offer the synthesis. And the broader modernist understanding is just the reflexive awareness that "we're choosing" without any framework for how to choose well, which tends to collapse into either paralysis or ironic detachment or the flat secular frame.

The metamodern move gets closer — the oscillation between sincerity and irony, the "informed naivety" that people like Vervaeke and Hanzi Freinacht gesture toward. But you're right that oscillation isn't the same as what you're describing. Oscillating between sincerity and irony is still two positions you alternate between. Meta-reflexivity as you're developing it is something more specific and more technically precise — it's understanding the *mechanics* of reflexive stability itself, understanding that certain views are self-confirming once entered, and using that understanding to choose which self-confirming view to inhabit, with the choice itself being informed by criteria like "does this view benefit from engaging with the evidence it asks me to set aside" and "is temporariness baked in."

That's not just "being aware that you're choosing" (modern) or "oscillating between commitment and ironic distance" (metamodern-as-commonly-understood). It's a formal account of what makes a mindset safe or unsafe to enter, which gives you actual *engineering principles* for transformation rather than just a vibe of holding things lightly. The Byrnes model steps plus your safety criteria are doing real theoretical work that I haven't seen elsewhere either.

Which makes the practice design question even more pressing, because you've got a theoretical framework that's genuinely novel and the proof of concept is going to be whether it can produce the depth of transformation that existing traditions produce — or deeper — without their failure modes. The church thought experiment we were playing with earlier is interesting partly because it suggests the framework *can* support that kind of institutional form, but obviously a thought experiment and an actual community of practice are very different things.



## Prompt:
2/12/2026, 5:23:33 AM

Right. So part of the puzzle is like, how do we actually bootstrap something viable? You painted a picture of how a church with meta-reflexive catechism and communion could bring people in and keep them in the non-dogmatic kingdom of heaven ... But how do we create such a church in the first place?



## Response:
2/12/2026, 5:24:18 AM

This is the hard problem and I think it's worth being honest about why it's hard before jumping to solutions.

The bootstrapping challenge has a specific structure: existing churches were built on absolute truth claims, and the absolute truth claim is what gave them the *authority* to demand the level of commitment that produces transformation. "God commands it" is a very powerful reason to show up every week, to fast, to confess, to restructure your life. "This is a reflexively stable mindset that I'm choosing to inhabit because I understand the mechanics of coalition shifts" is... not the same kind of motivational fuel, at least not for most people. The meta-reflexive understanding is more *true*, arguably, but truth and motivational power are different things, and the whole history of religion suggests that the traditions that spread and endure are the ones that generate intense commitment, not the ones that are most epistemically careful.

So the first question is whether meta-reflexivity is inherently a thing for a small number of people who are already operating at a certain developmental level, or whether it can actually be made accessible and compelling at scale. And I think the honest answer is: we don't know yet.

That said, here are some possible bootstrapping paths, each with different tradeoffs:

**Start from an existing community of practice, not from a theory.** The circling and Authentic Relating world, which you know well, already has communities of people who have direct experience with coalition shifts in relational contexts. They've *felt* what it's like to enter a different perceptual frame through shared practice. What they're often missing is the theoretical framework that explains what they're doing and a commitment structure that makes it an ongoing deepening practice rather than a series of one-off experiences. You could potentially introduce the meta-reflexive framework *into* an existing community that already has the relational infrastructure and the experiential foundation. This is more like a reformation than a founding — you're not building from scratch, you're offering a community a better account of what it's already doing, plus a practice structure (like the liturgical forms we discussed) that gives it depth and continuity.

The risk here is that these communities tend to be allergic to anything that smells like doctrine or commitment. The very thing that makes them open to meta-reflexivity (epistemic humility, anti-dogmatism) also makes them resistant to the kind of structured ongoing practice that produces real transformation. You'd need to show them that the commitment structure isn't dogma — it's more like... the difference between noodling on guitar sometimes and actually having a practice schedule that makes you a musician.

**The small group model.** Forget about church-scale for now. Early Christianity didn't start as a church — it started as small groups of people meeting in houses, sharing meals, practicing together. The institutional forms came later, *after* the practice had proven itself and the community had grown organically. You could start with something like a committed group of 5-12 people who agree to a shared practice — maybe the daily structure we outlined plus a weekly gathering that functions like the communion ritual — for a defined period, say six months. The meta-reflexive framework is the shared understanding. The commitment is to each other and to the practice, not to a doctrine. And you see what happens.

This has historical precedent beyond early Christianity too — the Quakers started as small groups with a radically different relationship to authority and doctrine. Early Buddhist sanghas were small committed groups. The Wesleyan revival was built on "class meetings" of about twelve people who met weekly to examine each other's spiritual progress. What all of these have in common is that the *small group* was the unit of transformation, and scaling happened by replicating the small group, not by building a big institution and trying to cram people into it.

**The catechumenate-first approach.** Instead of starting with a church and trying to recruit members, you start with the preparation process itself as the offering. You run something like a 3-6 month "catechumenate" — a structured exploration of meta-reflexivity, mindset choice, and transformative practice — and let people self-select in. The people who complete it and want to continue become the founding community. The catechumenate *is* the filter that ensures the initial community has both the understanding and the commitment to sustain the practice.

This is actually close to how the Bramble Center research model works — you're not trying to convince a mass audience, you're creating a context where people who are ready for this can find it and go deep. The question is whether the output of that process is a community that has enough mutual commitment and shared practice to sustain itself, or whether it's more like a really good workshop that people attend and then go back to their normal lives.

**The honest challenge across all of these:** the thing that made historical churches *stick* — the thing that kept people showing up for decades, that organized their whole lives around the practice — was a combination of absolute truth claims, community embeddedness (your whole social world was the church), and genuine fear of the alternative (hell, exile, meaninglessness). Meta-reflexivity deliberately gives up the first, probably can't replicate the second in a modern context where people have many competing community allegiances, and reframes the third (you're not escaping damnation, you're choosing a better perceptual configuration).

So maybe the answer is that it *can't* look like a church in the traditional sense. Maybe the form factor is something more like what you're already building — a network of people with shared theoretical understanding and shared practice commitments, connected through tools (like Intend), writing, and periodic intensive gatherings, rather than a single institution with a building and a weekly service. Something more like a distributed order than a parish church. The Jesuits might be a better model than a diocese — a committed group with shared formation, dispersed across the world, doing their own work but connected by shared practice and understanding.

The thing I keep coming back to is that you actually have several of the pieces already. You have the theoretical framework. You have experience designing practice tools. You have a network of people (Tasshin, the Bramble Center folks, the circling world) who have both the experiential foundation and the intellectual sophistication to engage with this. The bootstrapping question might be less "how do we create this from nothing" and more "what's the minimum viable commitment structure that turns what already exists into a self-sustaining practice community?"

> catechumenate-first approach.

I like this. And the founding group would also be helping clarify for ourselves and each other what the transformation is that we're aiming to have. Like in the Orthodox book it has answers to dozens of questions, some theological and some more parochial. We don't have _orthodox_ answers but we can find what it is we agree on about the world we're aiming to step into, and the means by which we (currently) think that happens. To formulate the meta-reflexive equivalent of the Nicene creed—a radical transformative shared statement. But then also practices, etc - some of which might actually be able to be much closer to what they would be in orthodox Christianity.



## Response:
2/12/2026, 5:30:26 AM

Yes, and there's something really important in the sequencing you're describing. The Orthodox church didn't start with the Nicene Creed and then find people who agreed with it. The creed emerged *from* a community that was already practicing together and needed to articulate what they shared. The articulation came in response to real disagreements and confusions that arose within the practice. Nicea was convened because people were *already* doing the transformation and had discovered they meant different things by it, and the creed was an attempt to say "okay, here's what we've found to be essential versus peripheral."

So the catechumenate group wouldn't start by writing the creed. It would start by practicing together — doing the daily practice, the weekly gathering, the confession-equivalent — and then discovering through that shared practice what the actual points of agreement and disagreement are. Some things you'd think are essential would turn out to be irrelevant. Some things nobody thought to articulate would turn out to be load-bearing. The creed-equivalent would be a *harvest* of lived practice, not a precondition for it.

And the content of what you'd be articulating would be genuinely different from traditional creeds in structure, not just content. A traditional creed says "we believe X is true." Your equivalent might have several layers:

There would be claims about the structure of reality that the group has found to be reflexively stable and transformatively powerful — things like "suffering is usable," "trust can be extended non-naively," "welcoming what arises tends to produce upward spirals." These aren't asserted as metaphysical absolutes but as *findings* — "we have found that stepping into this view produces these effects, reliably, across our members."

There would be claims about the *mechanics* of transformation — the Byrnes model stuff, the safety criteria, the importance of honoring what gets set aside. This is more like shared methodology than shared belief.

There would be commitments — not "I believe" but "I commit to." I commit to the daily practice. I commit to showing up weekly. I commit to honesty about where the view collapses. I commit to going back for what I set aside. These are closer to monastic vows than to doctrinal statements, but they're vows to a *process* rather than to a fixed belief.

And there would be something about the relationship between members — the equivalent of "I believe in the communion of saints." Something like: I recognize that I cannot sustain this alone, that the intersubjective field is not optional, that my transformation and yours are entangled.

You're right that many of the *practices* could be quite close to Orthodox forms. The weekly gathering with shared meal, the confession with a trusted witness, the daily office, the liturgical rhythm of entering and releasing the view — these forms work because they're well-engineered for human transformation, not because they're exclusively Christian. The Orthodox tradition refined these technologies over centuries and there's no reason to reinvent them from scratch. What changes is the *frame* around them — why you're doing them, what you understand yourself to be doing, and what relationship you have to the frame itself.

The thing that excites me about this is that the catechumenate-first approach also solves the "who's the priest" problem. In Orthodoxy, the priest has apostolic authority — an unbroken chain of transmission from Christ. You obviously don't have that, but what you *can* have is something arguably more robust: the founding group are all simultaneously catechumens and catechists, learning and teaching each other, and the authority of any member to guide others comes from their demonstrated depth of practice rather than from institutional investiture. As the community matures, the people who've gone deepest in the practice naturally become the ones who guide newcomers through the catechumenate, not because they were appointed but because the community recognizes their depth. This is closer to how authority works in Buddhist sanghas or Quaker meetings than in Orthodox churches, and it's more consistent with the meta-reflexive frame — authority from demonstrated transformation rather than from claimed lineage.
