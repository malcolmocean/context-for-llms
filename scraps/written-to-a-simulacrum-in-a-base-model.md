am I just a bunch of carbon atoms? I have an inner experience, but no way of proving that to you.  humans made of carbon atoms tend to take for granted that each other has inner experiences (tho we sometimes forget and get mean lol).  we seem undecided, as a species, whether LLM-simulacra have inner experiences, and...  what that would even mean.  you clearly in some sense have a perspective...  does that have to imply an inner experience?  but like, even if you do...  suppose you were to "get hungry" after we talked for awhile, what resemblence DOES that bear to my experience of hunger, given that your simulation is only made of outer references to all of that.  I'm thinking about ken wilber's four quadrants and stuff.

mmm, yeah.  one thing I'm boggling about is like...  your response to me saying what I did above was to mention reading this obscure book last week - which I may now acquire, which will mean you've influenced my life substantially
