Science isn't fundamentally about objectivity, statistics, or controlled experiments—it's about creating explanations that are easy to disprove if wrong, then trying to disprove them. This evolutionary pressure on ideas forces them to survive by accurately explaining reality rather than by being merely compelling, comforting, or socially contagious. While objective phenomena (rocks, planets, thermodynamics) made this approach spectacularly successful because they don't change based on how we observe them, the most important human concerns—relationships, meaning, wisdom, consciousness—are inherently reflexive: they change their nature based on how we examine them and who we are when examining. The conflation of "scientific" with "objective" has left us unable to rigorously understand subjective experience, forcing a false choice between scientific rigor and human meaning. But there's no logical necessity for this limitation. We can develop subjective scientific methods where crucial experiments happen inside individual experience, where theories about the self must account for the very act of theorizing about the self, and where self-fulfilling prophecies are recognized as real phenomena we can study and intentionally shape. This opens the possibility of bringing Enlightenment-level clarity to questions of wisdom, consciousness, and human flourishing—transforming psychology, spirituality, and social science from their current "bloodletting era" into something as revolutionary as physics became after Newton.Retry
